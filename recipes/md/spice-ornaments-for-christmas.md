# Spice Ornaments for Christmas

From Dorothy Matschek’s Classroom. Makes about 12 small or 6 large ornaments. These ornaments add a wonderful Christmassy smell to the house and are visually attractive. You can paint the front to make them even more decorative if you choose.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup ground cinnamon
- 3 T ground allspice
- 3 T ground cloves
- 2 T ground nutmeg
- 1 cup applesauce

## Instructions

1. Mix all ingredients together. This will form a thick “mud pie” looking dough
2. Roll or pat dough out to at least 1/4 inch thick _(It is important to make the dough thick or it will crumble when you try to lift the dried ornaments)_
3. Cut out shapes using Christmas cutters. Remove excess dough
4. Make a hole near the top of each ornament so you can hang it later
5. Let dry for several days, turning as appropriate

## Notes

At school, each child made their ornament on an individual margarine tub lid. At home, a small amount of dough was placed on a Teflon cookie sheet, cut, and shaped. Repeat with remaining dough.
