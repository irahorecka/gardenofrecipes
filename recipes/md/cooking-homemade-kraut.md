# Cooking Homemade Kraut

Old fashioned Bohemian style. You may use a can of bought kraut, but it is better if you use a jar of kraut.

## Instructions

1. When the kraut is ready to eat, put it in a pot
2. Add a small amount of waterâ€”not even enough to cover
3. Let it boil
4. Add bacon drippings
5. In a small bowl, mix a small amount of cold water with enough flour to make a thin paste
6. Pour the paste into the hot kraut while stirring
7. Let it boil
