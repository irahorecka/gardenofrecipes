# Hot Water Pie Crust

I haven't made this in 20 years.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup lard
- 1/2 cup boiling water
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 3 cups flour

## Instructions

1. Pour boiling water over lard and mix until creamy
2. Add dry ingredients and mix
3. Roll out dough
4. This dough is supposed to be easier to roll than other pie crusts
