# Head Sausage

Aunt Mary Appelt. This is very good for a breakfast treat.

## Instructions

1. Boil a hog head in lightly salted water until done (meat comes off the bones)
2. Optionally add hog ears and about 1/4 of the hog liver
3. While this is cooking, cook 2 1/2 to 3 cups rice in lightly salted water until tender. Let cool
4. Finely chop a medium onion and fry lightly—do not let it brown
5. Remove all meat from the broth and save the broth
6. Grind all the meat
7. Mix in the onion, pepper, a little sage, and a bit of finely chopped or mashed garlic with salt
8. Mix thoroughly and stuff very loosely in casings
9. Tie ends together and pierce the casings with a needle to prevent popping during reheating
10. Simmer in the saved broth—do not boil
11. Remove, cool, and store in freezer bags

## To Prepare

Place in a pan with a bit of water. Cover with foil and bake just to heat through slowly.
