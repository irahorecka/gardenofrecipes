# Spice Ornaments for Christmas

From Dorothy Matschek’s Classroom. Makes about 12 small or 6 large ornaments. These ornaments add a wonderful Christmassy smell to the house and are visually attractive. You can paint the front to make them even more decorative if you choose.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup ground cinnamon
- 3 tbsp ground allspice
- 3 tbsp ground cloves
- 2 tbsp ground nutmeg
- 1 cup applesauce

## Instructions

1. Mix all ingredients together. This will form a thick “mud pie” looking dough
2. Roll or pat dough out to at least 1/4 inch thick (it is important to make the dough thick or it will crumble when you try to lift the dried ornaments)
3. Cut out shapes using Christmas cutters. Remove excess dough
4. Make a hole near the top of each ornament so you can hang it later
5. Let dry for several days, turning as appropriate

## Notes

At school, each child made their ornament on an individual margarine tub lid. At home, a small amount of dough was placed on a Teflon cookie sheet, cut, and shaped. Repeat with remaining dough.
