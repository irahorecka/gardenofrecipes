# Sammy's Chili

This is from the restaurant where I was a cook. This is from a recipe for 10 pounds of meat, so it’s not exact.

## Ingredients (per 1 pound of meat)

- 1 lb chili meat
- Small amount of shortening
- 1 chopped onion
- 1 tbsp chili powder (or to taste)
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder (or 1 clove garlic, finely minced)
- 1 1/4 tsp paprika
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- Hot water to cover
- 2–3 tbsp flour mixed in cold water (for thickening)

## Instructions

1. In a heavy pot, brown the chili meat in shortening
2. Add chopped onion and cook until browned, stirring often
3. Add chili powder, garlic, paprika, salt, pepper, and cumin
4. Add hot water to cover and let simmer
5. Mix flour with cold water and stir until smooth
6. Stir this into the chili to thicken
7. Stir well to prevent burning

_Add spices to suit your own taste._

## Note

At Sammy’s, dry red peppers were used:

- Stems and as many seeds as possible were removed
- Peppers were boiled in water, then peeled once cooled
- The pulp was mashed or blended and added into the chili
