# Batter Baked Chicken

My Aunt Mary Janacek made this for us in 1918–1920. It was very good. I do not know the exact amount. I know it was delicious.

## Ingredients

- 1 cut up fryer, seasoned with flour, salt and pepper _(fry to brown)_
- Batter (similar to pancake batter, no sugar)
- 1 T finely chopped onion
- Some chopped green pepper
- Salt and pepper

## Instructions

1. Put the seasoned chicken in a large greased pan.
2. Make a batter similar to pancake batter (do not use sugar).
3. Add onion, green pepper, salt, and pepper to the batter.
4. Pour batter over the chicken.
5. Bake at 350°F until done.
